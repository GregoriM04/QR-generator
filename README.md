# QR Generator with JavaScript

![screenshot](/assets/images/screenshot.png "https://gregorim04.github.io/QR-generator/")

This is a simple QR generator component using [Goqr.me](https://goqr.me/) API, which can handle text or URL to generate the QR.

There was a lot of troubleshooting while coding this, especially when adding animations as feedback. However, it was totally worthwhile because it makes a huge difference, in my opinion. Plus, I learned a lot about the Js 'chain' processing stages (if that makes sense), and I managed to get what I intended in the first place.
